        [ ENHANCEMENTS ]
        - WARNING: backwards incompatible change!
          The original approach using subroutine attributes was pretty, but not
          always reliable (particularly with regards to thread safety, or
          running under the debugger or Devel::Cover etc).
          Since this module is still in it's early life and not widely used,
          I've refactored entirely, to use new requires_login / requires_role 
          etc keywords, which wrap the provided coderef in a coderef which 
          checks if the user is logged in / has the required role(s), before
          running the route handler provided.
        - Configurable /login, /logout URLs - Rene (hertell)

        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - Throw an error properly if not configured correctly - safer to refuse
          for anything to be served than to potentially serve stuff the user
          expected to be protected if their config is wrong.

        [ BUG FIXES ]
        - import Dancer DSL keywords, so call to debug() if user record is not
          found doesn't cause horrific fiery explosions (reported by rwb)
