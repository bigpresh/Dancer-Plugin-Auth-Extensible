=head1 NAME 

Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Database - authenticate via a database


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an authentication provider designed to authenticate users against
a database, using L<Dancer::Plugin::Database> to access a database.

L<Crypt::SaltedHash> is used to handle hashed passwords securely; you wouldn't
want to store plain text passwords now, would you?  (If your answer to that is
yes, please reconsider; you really don't want to do that, when it's so easy to
do things right!)

See L<Dancer::Plugin::Database> for how to configure a database connection
appropriately; see the L</CONFIGURATION> section below for how to configure this
authentication provider with database details.

See L<Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible> for details on how to use the
authentication framework, including how to pick a more useful authentication
provider.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

This provider tries to use sensible defaults, so you may not need to provide
much configuration if your database tables look similar to those in the
L</SUGGESTED SCHEMA> section below.

The most basic configuration, assuming defaults for all options, and defining a
single authentication realm named 'users':

    plugins:
        Auth::Extensible:
            realms:
                users:
                    provider: 'Database'

You would still need to have provided suitable database connection details to
L<Dancer::Plugin::Database>, of course;  see the docs for that plugin for full
details, but it could be as simple as, e.g.:

    plugins:
        Auth::Extensible:
            realms:
                users:
                    provider: 'Database'
        Database:
            driver: 'SQLite'
            database: 'test.sqlite'


A full example showing all options:

    plugins:
        Auth::Extensible:
            realms:
                users:
                    provider: 'Database'
                    # optionally set DB connection name to use (see named 
                    # connections in Dancer::Plugin::Database docs)
                    db_connection_name: 'foo'

                    # Optionally disable roles support, if you only want to check
                    # for successful logins but don't need to use role-based access:
                    disable_roles: 1

                    # optionally specify names of tables if they're not the defaults
                    # (defaults are 'users', 'roles' and 'user_roles')
                    users_table: 'users'
                    roles_table: 'roles'
                    user_roles_table: 'user_roles'

                    # optionally set the column names (see the SUGGESTED SCHEMA
                    # section below for the default names; if you use them, they'll
                    # Just Work)
                    users_id_column: 'id'
                    users_username_column: 'username'
                    users_password_column: 'password'
                    roles_id_column: 'id'
                    roles_role_column: 'role'
                    user_roles_user_id_column: 'user_id'
                    user_roles_role_id_column: 'roles_id'

See the main L<Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible> documentation for how to
configure multiple authentication realms.

=head1 SUGGESTED SCHEMA

If you use a schema similar to the examples provided here, you should need
minimal configuration to get this authentication provider to work for you.

The examples given here should be MySQL-compatible; minimal changes should be
required to use them with other database engines.

=head2 users table

You'll need a table to store user accounts in, of course.  A suggestion is
something like:

    CREATE TABLE users (
        id       INTEGER     AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL       UNIQUE KEY,
        password VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL
    );

You will quite likely want other fields to store e.g. the user's name, email
address, etc; all columns from the users table will be returned by the
C<logged_in_user> keyword for your convenience.

=head2 roles table

You'll need a table to store a list of available roles in (unless you're not
using roles - in which case, disable role support (see the L</CONFIGURATION>
section).

    CREATE TABLE roles (
        id    INTEGER     AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        role  VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
    );

=head2 user_roles table

Finally, (unless you've disabled role support)  you'll need a table to store
user <-> role mappings (i.e. one row for every role a user has; so adding 
extra roles to a user consists of adding a new role to this table).  It's 
entirely up to you whether you use an "id" column in this table; you probably
shouldn't need it.

    CREATE TABLE user_roles (
        user_id  INTEGER  NOT NULL,
        role_id  INTEGER  NOT NULL,
        UNIQUE KEY user_role (user_id, role_id)
    );

If you're using InnoDB tables rather than the default MyISAM, you could add a
foreign key constraint for better data integrity; see the MySQL documentation
for details, but a table definition using foreign keys could look like:

    CREATE TABLE user_roles (
        user_id  INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
        role_id  INTEGER, FOREIGN_KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles (id),
        UNIQUE KEY user_role (user_id, role_id)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB;

    # Right, fetch the roles they have.  There's currently no support for
    # JOINs in Dancer::Plugin::Database, so we'll need to do this query
    # ourselves - so we'd better take care to quote the table & column names, as
    # we're going to have to interpolate them.  (They're coming from our config,
    # so should be pretty trustable, but they might conflict with reserved
    # identifiers or have unacceptable characters to not be quoted.)
    # Because I've tried to be so flexible in allowing the user to configure
    # table names, column names, etc, this is going to be fucking ugly.
    # Seriously ugly.  Clear bag of smashed arseholes territory.
